# BIRDSPARK
BIRD Transformations in Apache Spark

We aim for good compatibility with the open source Apache Spline project (https://github.com/AbsaOSS/spline) 

Spline shows lineage of Spark processing and was created  to meet Regulatory BCBS 239 standard for lineage of aggregated data.

Spline was created by ABSA which is one of the largest banks in South Africa.
